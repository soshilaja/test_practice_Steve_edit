# test_practice_Steve_edit

Test practice from "Wombats team". writting specs for a string function, then testing someone else's specs (duplicate chars) and finally implementing function for others specs and test (find-a-word).

This Fork contains the changes I made to the code and test submitted by Claudia Ton and made the code to run well and the test to pass
